# Cloud Query API

This project involved building a backend system for a passenger airline that sells tickets. A relational database was designed using PostgreSQL to efficiently store and manage data, aligned with the airline’s business needs.

A full set of RESTful API endpoints was developed to handle key operations like flight and seat management, bookings, payments, and online check-ins. The system also included analytical features such as retrieving top destinations, routes with the most passengers, and revenue breakdowns by payment type per route.

The API served as the core of the ticket-selling platform, providing essential functionalities for users and admins while ensuring reliable data processing and smooth system performance.

## Project Overview  

### Airline Management System Documentation 
This document aims to help and guide the clients of the database regarding  how to install, run, and interact with the database's RESTful API and to provide a good sense of how the ins and outs of this system work along with an in-depth explanation of each functionality's required parameters.

This project uses:  
- **Necessary modules and libraries**: Flask, JWT, Bycrypt, Logging, Psycopg2, Time, Datetime
- **Necessary software**: An IDE for Python, Docker, Postman, and A client to connect to the SQL DBMS.

**Important Note**: 

All users should know that to access and interact with some of the functionalities, a previous login will be required, done through the Login endpoint, to verify the user's access authorizations. From this point till the end of the documentation, the functionalities that require admin, passenger, or crew member  credentials will be added below their respective functionalities tab and all functionalities listed below the general functionalities tab do not require any login to be used.

## User Roles Functionalities and API Endpoints
### Administrator Functionalities  
1. **Add Admins**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /cloud_query/admin`
   - **Input Parameters**: "username, email, password" (of the user we want to add as admin).
   - **Result**: The result in case of successful insertion would be the created Admin´s "user_id". 
   - **Note**: It is important to note that since only admins can add other admins we need to use the username, email, and password of the person we want to add as admin after logging in.
2. **Add Airport**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /cloud_query/airport`  
   - **Input Parameters**: "city, name, country"
   - **Result**: This functionality returns the "airport_id" of the created airport.
   - **Note**: Using this functionality we can add airports to our database. 
3. **Add Flight**  
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /cloud_query/flight`  
   - **Input Parameters**: "departure_time, arrival_time, existing_seats, ,airport_dep, airport_arr"
   - **Result**: This functionality returns the "flight_code" of the created flight.
   - **Note**: The functionality is used to add flights to the database it is to note that "airport_dep" refers to the departure airports and the "airport_arr" refers to arrival airports.
4. **Add Schedule**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /cloud_query/schedule`  
   - **Input Paramets**: "flight_code, date, crew_id, ticket_price"
   - **Result**: In case of a successful insert it should return the "schedule_id" of the created schedule.
   - **Note**: To create Schedules it will be necessary to have previously created a flight and a crew to be able to associate their IDs with the respective flight schedule.
5. **Create Crew**
   - **Endpoint**: `Post /cloud_query/crew`
   - **Input Parameters**: Just an admin login is required to create the respective crews.
   - **Result**: The result in case of a correct insertion should be the "crew_id".
   - **Note**: In this particular functionality we use the admin credentials to Login and by doing this we automatically generate a "crew-id" which will be later attached to the crew members of the referred crew.
6. **Add Crew Members**
   - **Endpoint**: `Post /cloud_query/crew_member`
   - **Input Parameters**: "username, email, password, role, crew_id"
   - **Result**: Similar to the add passenger and add admin functionalities the result after a successful insertion should be the registered "user_id".
   - **Note**: To add a crew member, a crew has to be previously created with the Add Crew functionality since it is necessary to associate the crew members with their respective crew using the "crew_id" It is also to note that the possible role entries are either "Pilot" or "Flight_attendant".
7. **Get Crew**
   - **Endpoint**:`GET /cloud_query/crew`
   - **Input Parameters**: Similar to the create crew functionality no input would be required a simple login of an admin would suffice to get all the Crew's information.
   - **Result**: The result would be the demonstration of all Crews information which includes the "user_id" of the admin who created the crew, the "user_id" of the crew chief  (if non-existent this would be filled with NULL instead), and finally the respective "crew_id".
   - **Note**: Demonstrates all the information from the Crew table.
8. **Financial data**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /cloud_query/financial_data`
   - **Input Parameters**: Like some of the functionalities mentioned before this one also does not require any special input parameters only an admin login is necessary.
   - **Result**: The result of this functionality in case of a successful connection would have this format: "Credit Card, Debit Card, MBway, Flight_code, total" where each of the illustrated keys would be mapped to their respective numbers.
   - **Note**: This functionality aims to get all the information of all payments made in different methods associated with their respective flight_code.
9. **Add Supervisor**
    - **Endpoint**: `Post /cloud_query/crew_supervisor`
    - **Input Parameters**: "crew_id, crew_member"
    - **Result**: In case of a successful insertion the message "Supervisor was added with success. Crew member (user_id) supervisor (crew_id)."
    - **Note**: It is important to note only the admins who have created a respective crew can add a supervisor for it.
     
### Passenger Functionalities  
1. **Booking Flight**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /cloud_query/Book_flight`
   - **Input Parameters**: "flight_code, date, ticket_quantity, seat_id"
   - **Result**: In case of a successful insertion the result would be a message that confirms the insertion and directs the client for payment with the associated "booking_id".
   - **Note**: It is of great importance to note that in this particular functionality the "seat_id" will correspond to an array of seats that the client is planning to book. The format would be provided in the "Input example for Postman document".
2. **Info Booking**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /cloud_query/Info_booking`
   - **Input Parameters**: There are none required.
   - **Result**: The result would demonstrate all bookings information which includes: "booking_id, flight_code, flight_date, amount to pay, and ticket_quantity".

    Note:
   
   While accessing the database it is important to note that the user used for accessing the database must have the necessary permissions to access and modify the tables a superuser would be advised).
   Login to the database using your preferred DBMS client(pgadmin4, dbeaver, etc)
5. Install Docker:

   Note:
   The script creates a container that contains the database and the API.
   ```bash
   https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
   ```
   Install docker and activate docker scripts included in the file "docker-compose-python-psql.sh"
 7. Run the code:
    ```bash
    cloud_query.py
    ```
9. Now for a final step you can use Postman to interact with the API and the database using the endpoints provided previously.
